# Datasets_and_benchmarks
\item Collect existing datasets and benchmarks:
- Images Classification: MNIST,CIFAR,ImageNet
- Image Segmentation: VOC2012-2014
- Videos data: Kinetics 400, UCF101
- Neural data: NLB, Sensorium, MTNeuro, TUH, HCP
\item Steps to pre-process data:
- Data cleaning: Clean and remove any inconsistent or missing data
- Data normalization: Normalize the data so that all features have the same scale and units.
- Feature extraction: Extract meaningful features from the raw data
- Data augmentation
- Data splitting: Split the data into training, validation, and test sets
\item Publish new datasets and benchmarks: (NeurIPS guidelines)
- Formatting: data format and read/write tools
- Documentation: instructions to use the data and associated tools
- Maintenance: how the datasets are archived and updated over time
- Ethics: biases in the data, personal identifiable information within the data
- Licensing: how the data can be distributed for research/commercial purposes
